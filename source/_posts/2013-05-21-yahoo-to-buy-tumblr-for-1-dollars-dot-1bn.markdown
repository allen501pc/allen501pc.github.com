Yahoo to buy Tumblr for $1.1bn
<!--more-->

Yahoo has agreed a deal to buy New York-based blogging service Tumblr for $1.1bn (￡723m; 857m euros) in cash.
Yahoo's chief executive Marissa Mayer said that as part of its promise "not to screw it up", Tumblr would operate independently.  
David Karp, will continue as chief executive officer of Tumblr.  
The deal is the largest made by Ms Mayer since she took the helm at Yahoo last July, and she described the acquisition as a "unique opportunity."  
"On many levels, Tumblr and Yahoo couldn't be more different, but at the same time, they couldn't be more complementary," added Ms Mayer.  
Mr Karp, 26, who owns 25% of the privately-owned company he co-founded with Marco Arment in 2007, said he was "elated" to have the support of Yahoo.  
"Tumblr gets better faster with more resources to draw from," he added. Mr Karp emphasised that neither its aims or team was changing as a result of Yahoo's purchase.

Mobile devices
The $1.1bn price tag for Tumblr represents a significant premium on its $800m valuation when it last raised money from private investors.  
Tumblr's 2012 revenue was just $13m, according to a report by Forbes magazine, leading analysts to suggest Yahoo had overpaid for the deal.  
"Even if revenue was $100 million, it means Yahoo paid 10 times revenue," said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis. "Ten times is what you pay to date the belle of the ball. It's on the outer bands of M&A."  
Tumblr combines elements of blogging with social networking, and its simple design has attracted millions of users since its launch.  
According to its homepage, it now hosts 108 million blogs, with a total of 50.7 billion posts.  
It also has a significant presence on mobile devices.  
But despite its fast-growing user base, it has struggled to make money and has traditionally resisted advertising.  
It said in April 2012 that it would roll out limited use of adverts.  
Ms Mayer said Yahoo would now work with Tumblr to create ads that "are seamless and enhance the user experience".  
Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said that the quickest way for Yahoo to boost Tumblr's revenue would be to combine its sales force with the blogging site, but that this would risk alienating users.  
"It's not clear that this deal will be favourable from a return-on-capital perspective," Wieser said. "One billion [dollars] for one company is a big bet."
Yahoo remains a giant in the internet world, with around 700 million visitors to its website every month. The majority of its revenues come from advertising.
But it has limited mobile reach and lags behind Google in the search engine rankings.  
It also shed more than 1,000 jobs during 2012 and has long been divided over whether it should focus on media content or on tools and technologies.

####Translation  
Yahoo 以11億美元買下Tumblr  
Yahoo 已經以11億美元現金(相當於7.23億英鎊或8.57億歐元)同意購買以紐約為主的部落格服務Tumblr。   
Yahoo的執行長Marissa Mayer說：「就如同它承諾的一部分『別把它搞砸了』。」，Tumblr會獨立運作。   
David Karp將續任Tumblr的執行長。這是Mayer女士自去年七月接棒Yahoo有史以來的最大交易案，而她描述此一購案是「大好機會」。 
「在許多層面來看，Tumblr與Yahoo不會有太多不同，但同時也不會更為互補。」  
現年26歲的Karp先生，於2007年間，擁有與Marco Arment合夥的私人公司25%的股權，說他對於Yahoo的支援感到「非常得意」。  
「Tumblr隨著更多資源的投入，會變得更好更快來吸引更多的人」他補充道。Karp先生強調當Yahoo付現成定局時，Tumblr的目標或是團隊也不會改變。  

**行動裝置**

標價11億美金對Tumblr而言，代表更顯著的加價，私人投資者之前曾加價達8億美元。  
根據富比士雜誌報導，Tumblr在2012年的收入只有1,300萬美元，首席分析師暗示Yahoo對此交易案多付了太多錢。「即使收入僅有1億美元，表示Yahoo付了10倍的收入」BGC財經分析師Colin Gillis說道。「十倍好比你可以跟球賽美女約會。它是企業購併的例外。」    
Tumblr把社群網路與部落格元素作結合，自它上線以來，其簡單設計已經吸引了上百萬名使用者。
根據它的首頁顯示，現有1億800萬個部落格，共有507億篇文章。  
它在行動裝置上也有值得注意的存在感。
但除了快速成長的使用者基礎，它面臨賺錢與傳統上反廣告的困窘。  
在2012年四月即公告將移除廣告的限制。  
Mayer女士說Yahoo將與Tumblr合作，建立無縫廣告與強化使用者體驗。
關鍵研究社群的分析師Brain Wieser說，Yahoo強化Tumblr營收的最快方法是結合與部落格網址結合它自己的銷售力，但將遭受使用者流失的風險。  
「從投資報酬率觀點來看，無法清楚得知這是否有利。」Wieser說道。「10億對於一家公司來說是個大賭注」。
Yahoo仍是個網路巨人，每月約7億的瀏覽量。其主要營收來自廣告。
但是它那有限的行動觸角，在網路搜尋引擎的排名中，仍落後於Google。  
在2012年間，它也取消超過1,000個職位，已有很長一段時間處於是否該注重媒體內容或是科技工具的意見分歧中。
