During these days, I am programming MongoDB programs in C#. I've found there are some materials as shown as below. Hope that help you a lot. 

* [Getting started with MongoDB in C#](http://kashfarooq.wordpress.com/2012/02/18/getting-started-with-mongodb-in-c/)
* [Getting Started with the CSharp Driver](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tutorial/getting-started-with-csharp-driver/#getting-started-with-csharp-driver)

By default, note that your database connection string should be *http://your_host:27017/your_db_name*.
